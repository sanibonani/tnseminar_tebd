# tnseminar_tebd
A jupyter notebook for learning about TEBD based on <cite>Glen Evenbly https://www.tensors.net</cite>

For installation I recommend to use poetry [1]. Just clone the repository and run `poetry install`. 
Then the fun can start once you started a `poetry shell` and a `jupyter notebook`!

If you want to install by hand make sure you have python3 running in your working environment and that
you have installed:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- jupyter
